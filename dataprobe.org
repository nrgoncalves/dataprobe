* Todo [0%]
** TODO Graph checks (e.g. connected, acyclic, unidirectional, bidirectional, etc...)
e.g. 
node a is source (directed graphs only?)
node a is sink (directed graphs only?)
nodes a and b are connected (they are part of the same connected component)
nodes a and b are not connected at all (they are not part of the same connected component)
** TODO probabilistic value constraints
e.g. 
- this value comes from a Normal with bla bla
- this value is between bla and bla with 95% confidence
** TODO custom constraints
This is mostly a documentation task, I think.
Implement a class that extends ValueConstraint, CorrespondenceConstraint, etc as appropriate
** TODO Add proper data generation for tests
** TODO Work on Exceptions
** TODO should make the required arguments for a particular class more obvious 
I am thinking of having a method that ingests kwargs and stores them into properties
Or alternatively -- specify them as properties in the first place.
dataclasses are a nice way to handle this, but not sure if people are running Python 3.7
** TODO constrain should accept multiple inputs (e.g. a list of contraints)
** TODO save probe such that it can be shared with others
** TODO Text constraints (more generally than just strings)
This would be interesting for getting into the NLP area -- but has to provide some value.
** TODO string parsing would probably be a more elegant way of doing things
e.g. OneToMany('EquipmentID->JobNumber') but this might be a pain if columns have spaces (it is a potential source of headaches I think)
alternatively, might be best to use a dict where key is the origin and value is the destination
